          There was a time before mortals had found the divine, before meaning clung to their thoughts and formed into words, and when that time had passed the first of the the words of mortals sparked the creation of the divine. In that moment Automa, diety of the passing of time who pushes all things towards their end, began to write. They wrote in the words of mortals all that was happening so that the past might stay in it's place and the future unfold properly from the past as written.

          This was how the world was for many eons, until finally: Lethiam, diety of truth demanded to see the record of Automa to verify the correctness of the record. Automa was to say the least offended by the notion that they had subverted their duties and in the ensuing conflict pages of the book were ripped out and thrown to the divine winds. When finally Lethiam had sated their curiosity and verified their correctness they only had the smallest inkling of the damage that had been done.

          From that day forward wizards and sorcerors and beings of great power would seek out these pages for one who wrote in them would reweave the history of the world to include what they wrote. We are a conclave of such wizards and powerful beings, adeventurer, and the time has come to write your legend in the Book!
